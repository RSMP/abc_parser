module ABC
  # An abc file consists of one or more abc tune transcriptions,
  # optionally interspersed with free text and typeset text
  # annotations. It may optionally start with a file header to
  # set up default values for processing the file.
  #
  # The file header, abc tunes and text annotations are separated
  # from each other by empty lines (also known as blank lines).
  #
  # An abc file with more than one tune in it is called an abc
  # tunebook.
